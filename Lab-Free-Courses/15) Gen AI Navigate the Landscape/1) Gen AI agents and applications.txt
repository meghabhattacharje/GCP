1) A travel agency wants to use an AI agent to help customers plan their vacations. The agent should be able to:
• Gather customer preferences (budget, destination interests, travel dates).
• Search for flights, accommodations, and activities.
• Create personalized itineraries with options and recommendations.
• Book flights and hotels based on customer choices.
• Provide ongoing support throughout the trip.
How would the "agents" layer and the "applications" layer work together to create this AI powered travel planning experience?

ans) The agents layer would define the AI's capabilities (searching, booking, recommending), while the applications layer would provide the user-facing tool (website or app) to interact with the agent.


2) A data science team is training a new generative AI model on a massive dataset of images. They need access to powerful hardware and software resources to handle the computationally intensive training process.
Which layer of the gen AI landscape would provide the necessary computational power and storage for this data science team?

ans) Infrastructure


3) A game developer wants to create more realistic and engaging non-player characters (NPCs) in their game. They envision NPCs that can:
• Engage in dynamic conversations with the player.
• React to the player's actions and choices.
• Adapt their behavior based on the game's environment and storyline.
• Exhibit unique personalities and backstories.
Which layer of the gen AI landscape would be MOST crucial in defining the behaviors and capabilities of these AI powered NPCs?

ans) Agents

4) What are the two key elements that distinguish AI agents from standalone AI models?
ans) Reasoning loop and tools.

5) A news organization wants to develop an AI agent that delivers personalized news to each user. The agent should be able to:
• Learn the user's interests and reading habits.
• Filter and prioritize news articles based on relevance.
• Summarize key information from multiple sources.
• Recommend related articles and diverse perspectives.
• Adapt to the user's feedback and evolving preferences.
How would the "agents" layer contribute to the functionality of this personalized news reader application?

ans) The agents layer would define the specific tasks the AI performs, such as filtering articles, summarizing information, and making recommendations.
