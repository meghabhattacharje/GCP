1) Which type of foundation model would be most suitable for generating photorealistic images from textual descriptions?
ans) Diffusion model

2) Why is fine-tuning and customization an important factor when choosing a model?
ans) It allows the model to be adapted for specific tasks or domains.

3) What is the primary role of humans in the loop (HITL) in machine learning?
ans) To integrate human expertise into the ML process, especially for tasks requiring judgment or context.

4) Which techniques can be used to overcome the limitations of foundation model performance?
ans) Grounding, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and humans in the loop (HITL).

5) Which type of foundation model is specifically designed to understand and generate human language?
ans) Large language model (LLM)

6) What is the primary purpose of grounding in generative AI?
ans) To connect the AI's output to verifiable sources of information.
