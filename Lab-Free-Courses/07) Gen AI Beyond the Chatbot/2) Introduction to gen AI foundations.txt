1) Which of the following is NOT a key feature of foundation models?
ans) Specialized to specific tasks.

2) What is the purpose of a prompt in the context of foundation models?
ans) To provide input to the model and trigger an output.

3) How do foundation models and prompt engineering work together to create value in generative AI?
ans) Foundation models offer a vast knowledge base, and prompt engineering guides the model to use this knowledge in responses.

4) What is the primary difference between foundation models and traditional AI models?
ans) Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of diverse data for various tasks, while traditional models are trained on specific data for a single task.

5) Which of the following best defines a foundation model?
ans) Large AI models trained on a vast quantity of data, capable of adapting to a variety of tasks.
